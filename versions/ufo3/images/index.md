Image files referenced by glyphs in the UFO must be stored in the *images* directory. Subdirectories and symlinks within *images* are not allowed. These images must be in PNG format. Each file must have a unique name but there are no file name requirements beyond making the file names file system appropriate. Duplicate images should be avoided and unreferenced images should not be stored, but these are recommendations not requirements.
