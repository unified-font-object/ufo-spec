A UFO file is a directory following this structure:

{: .filediagram}
- {: .filediagramDirectory}*.ufo
  - metainfo.plist
  - fontinfo.plist
  - groups.plist
  - kerning.plist
  - features.fea
  - lib.plist
  - {: .filediagramDirectory}glyphs
    - contents.plist
    - .glif


Each of the files has a unique meaning, purpose and data structure:
