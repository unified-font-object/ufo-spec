| **File Format** | XML |

The Glyph Interchange Format (GLIF) is a simple and clear XML representation of a single glyph. GLIF files typically have a *.glif* extension.

## Specification

### \<glyph> The top level element.

#### Attributes

| attribute name | description                             |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| name           | The name of the glyph                   |
| format         | The format version. 1 for this version. |

The *name* attribute has limited uses in this version. The *contents.plist* file maps glyph names to file names, and one of the reasons to do this is to avoid having to parse all files just to get at a list of available glyph names. When reading GLIF files, the *name* attribute is probably best ignored, since manual editing may have caused a mismatch with the glyph name as stored in *contents.plist*, as well as with the file name, which is an algorithmic transformation of the glyph name. This attribute may become more useful in future versions of GLIF.

#### Child Elements

| element name | description                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| advance      | May occur at most once.        |
| unicode      | May occur any number of times. |
| outline      | May occur at most once.        |
| lib          | May occur at most once.        |

### \<advance> Horizontal and vertical metrics.

#### Attributes

| attribute name | data type        | description           |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| width          | integer or float | The advance width.    |
| height         | integer or float | The vertical advance. |

This element has no child elements.

### \<unicode> Unicode code point.

#### Attributes

| attribute name | description                                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| hex            | A unicode code point as a hexadecimal number. |

This element has no child elements. The first occurrence of this element defines the primary unicode value for this glyph.

### \<outline> Outline description.

#### Child Elements

| element name | description                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| component    | May occur any number of times. |
| contour      | May occur any number of times. |

This element has no attributes.

### \<component> Insert another glyph as part of the outline.

#### Attributes

| attribute name | data type        | description            | default value |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| base           | string           | Name of the base glyph | None          |
| xScale         | integer or float | See below.             | 1             |
| xyScale        | integer or float | See below.             | 0             |
| yxScale        | integer or float | See below.             | 0             |
| yScale         | integer or float | See below.             | 1             |
| xOffset        | integer or float | See below.             | 0             |
| yOffset        | integer or float | See below.             | 0             |

xScale, xyScale, yxScale, yScale, xOffset, yOffset taken together in that order form an Affine transformation matrix, to be used to transform the base glyph. The default matrix is \[1 0 0 1 0 0\], the identity transformation.

This element has no child elements.

### \<contour> Contour descript
