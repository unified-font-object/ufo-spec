	<p>
		This file contains the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/">Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType</a> feature definitions. This file is optional. If it is not defined in the UFO, there is no feature data.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is important to note that the features file may contain data that is a duplicate of or data that is in conflict with the data in <a href="kerning.html">kerning.plist</a>, <a href="groups.html">groups.plist</a> and <a href="fontinfo.html">fontinfo.plist</a>. Synchronization between the files is not a requirement of this specification. Synchronization is up to the user and authoring tool developers.
	</p>

	<h2>Specification</h2>
	<p>
		The file must be a plain text file and it should be in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html">AFDKO syntax</a>. If a feature file is present, it must be self-contained; for example, any glyph or mark classes must be defined within the file. No assumption should be made about the validity of the syntax.
	</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<pre>
@myClass = [a b c];
feature liga {
  sub f i by fi;
  sub f l by fl;
} liga;
	</pre>
